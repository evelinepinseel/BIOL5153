The raw score and the bit score do not vary with the size of the database.
The e-value increases with the size of the database.
This is because the raw score and the bit score are direclty based on sequence similarity and independent of database size.
In contrast, the e-value indicates the number of hits to be expected by chance: i.e. the larger a database, the higher the number of hits to be expected by pure chance.
